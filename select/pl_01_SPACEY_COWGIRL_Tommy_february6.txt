I'm in a rocket heading
into space
I see the cosmic rays
You know the outlaws
won't get away
A planet
I have never seen before
They're gonna hit the floor
And now I just saved another day
Riding on a comet tail
into a bright red solar flare
I wanna take you 'round
in orbit, babe,
we're goin' far beyond the air
somewhere
Just buckle up,
I'll take you to another
wo-o-orld
I am the one and only
spacey cowgirl
Galaxies away I'm gearin' up
Satellites are on your position
Ride the Milky Way,
I'm catchin' up
And now
I'm counting down until ignition
Lasers ready now, you can't run
Desperados try to escape me
Hold on steady now, I got one
I close the cases using
my astronomy
＜♪＞
They'll try to hide
behind a dark eclipse
Well they can read my lips
I don't give up 'til
I hunt you down
I travel out among
the shootings stars
It's really not that far
Look at the meteors all around
Light years past the supernova
there's a nebula saloon
Before I head out
on another bounty,
have a corona on the moon,
high noon
Just buckle up,
I'll take you to another
wo-o-orld
I am the one and only
spacey cowgirl
Galaxies away I'm gearin' up
Satellites are on your position
Ride the Milky Way,
I'm catchin' up
And now
I'm counting down until ignition
Lasers ready now, you can't run
Desperados try to escape me
Hold on steady now, I got one
I close the cases using
my astronomy
＜♪＞
This cowgirl won't be denied
I'm droppin' out of the sky
Six-shooter ray guns in hand
Galactic rodeo
This cowgirl won't be denied
I'm droppin' out of the sky
Six-shooter ray guns in hand
Galactic rodeo
＜♪＞
Galaxies away I'm gearin' up
Satellites are on your position
Ride the Milky Way,
I'm catchin' up
And now
I'm counting down until ignition

Hold on steady now, I got one
